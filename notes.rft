FUTURE DIRECTIONS

    • Topos theory (PROMISING): I don't know enough about topos theory to pursue this direction at the moment.
    • DisCoPyro (VERY PROMISING): There is only one paper on the subject at the moment. The paper is exceptionally dense, and likely presupposes advanced knowledge in statistics and graph theory, which I don't have at the moment.
